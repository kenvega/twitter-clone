The Follow model was very new and complex to me to make a single file about it
Mainly because I also don't get english very well so I needed association names that really explained to me what was happening.
After searching for how to make things work with the names I wanted I ended up with files like these:

# migration
class CreateFollows < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :follows do |t|
      t.references :follower, null: false, foreign_key: { to_table: :users }
      t.references :followed, null: false, foreign_key: { to_table: :users }

      # add unique index because user cannot follow the same person twice
      t.index [:follower_id, :followed_id], unique: true

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

# follow model
class Follow < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :follower, class_name: "User"
  belongs_to :followed, class_name: "User"
end

# user model
class User < ApplicationRecord
  ...
  has_many :given_follows, foreign_key: :follower_id, class_name: "Follow" # represents all the Follow instances where the user instance is the follower.
  has_many :followed_users, through: :given_follows, source: :followed # represents the users that the user instance is following.

  has_many :received_follows, foreign_key: :followed_id, class_name: "Follow" # represents all the Follow instances where the user is followed.
  has_many :followers, through: :received_follows, source: :follower # represents the users that a user is being followed by
  ...
end

# and for the user test
  ...
  it { should have_many(:given_follows).with_foreign_key(:follower_id).class_name("Follow") }
  it { should have_many(:followed_users).through(:given_follows).source(:followed) }
  it { should have_many(:received_follows).with_foreign_key(:followed_id).class_name("Follow") }
  it { should have_many(:followers).through(:received_follows).source(:follower) }
  ...



The naming changed from the tutorial to what I did in the end. This table helps as a reference to that change
