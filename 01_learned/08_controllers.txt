some methods you can use in the controllers

  redirect_to

    example for the home controller the user does not need to see home once is logged in

      so you can set the controller like this

      class HomeController < ApplicationController
        def index
          redirect_to dashboard_path if user_signed_in?
        end
      end

you can set a redirection method if some conditions happen

  for example in the application_controller.rb there is this line

    before_action :redirect_to_username_form, if: -> { user_signed_in? && current_user.username.blank? }

    it will run the redirect_to_username_form method if the user is signed in but it has no username assigned
      this is for the users to complete their username if they were created before the username column was added

you might prefer to create a UsernameController instead of a UserController

  this controller then can handle
    the endpoint to recieve the new username data
    the endpoint to return the form view for the new username to set if user does not have username set

  this way you can reduce the responsabilities of the UserController if it is ever created and that makes it easier to maintain
