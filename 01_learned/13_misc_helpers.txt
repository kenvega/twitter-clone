helper methods I saw that are not exactly related to controllers, models, etc

  .humanize

    you can get a name from a username

      "john_doe".humanize  --> "John doe"


ActiveSupport (maybe it should be its own file (?))
  extends Ruby's core classes with more functionality

  some added methods

    delegate

      coming from the delegation design pattern where one object forwards certain methods to another object
        it's just a way to simplify code

      it's a way to define delegations without writing manually the code that delegates the methods
        this reduces boilerplate code

      example: in the context of a User model with a Employee model with a has_one relationship
        instead of this

          class Employee < ApplicationRecord
            has_many :tasks

            def name
              user.name
            end

            def age
              user.age
            end
          end

        we can just use the shortcut of delegating the methods directly to the user model

          class Employee < ApplicationRecord
            has_many :tasks
            delegate :name, :age, to: :user
          end
