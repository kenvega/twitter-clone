counter_cache can be used to reduce the number of COUNT queries

  example trying to reduce the queries to get the number of likes of tweet

    we first create a migration to add to the 'tweets' table a new column that tracks the number of likes

      bundle exec rails g migration add_likes_count_to_tweets likes_counter:integer

    the migration should have an 'up' method where you take into account the number of likes of already existing tweets

      class AddLikesCountToTweets < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
        def up
          add_column :tweets, :likes_count, :integer, null: false, default: 0

          Tweet.find_each do |tweet|
            tweet.update!(likes_count: tweet.likes.size)
          end
        end

        def down
          remove_column :tweets, :likes_count
        end
      end

    then run the migration

      bundle exec rails db:migrate db:test:prepare

    then in the like model you will need to add the option counter_cache and the column name that it is targeting

      class Like < ApplicationRecord
        belongs_to :tweet, counter_cache: :likes_count
        ...
      end

    then you can replace your views

      from this

        <span><%= tweet_presenter.likes.size %></span>

      to this

        <span><%= tweet_presenter.likes_count %></span>
