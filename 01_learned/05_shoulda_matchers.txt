you have to add this
  Shoulda::Matchers.configure do |config|
    config.integrate do |with|
      with.test_framework :rspec
      with.library :rails
    end
  end

at the end of your spec/rails_helper.rb file according to the docs

  this allows methods like .dependent to be identified by rspec
