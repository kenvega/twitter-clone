to destroy all data from your database you can do

  rails db:reset

  this will do the following:

    - drop the databases (development and test databases. probably production too i haven't tested it)
    - create the databases
    - load the schema (make sure this is in sync with the migrations)
    - seed the database

  if you know the schema is not in sync with migrations, then instead of doing reset you can do this:

    rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed

      this will not read from the schema but from the migrations

to seed data so new people coming to your project can jump start with data

  rails db:seed

  you will need to fill the file db/seeds.rb

    creating data that will be necessary. in this case: users, tweets, tweet_activities, etc
