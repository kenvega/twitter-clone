command to generate the basic tweet model/table
  bundle exec rails g model Tweet user:references body:string

    this creates some files (migrations, models, and specs)

      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20230212141726_create_tweets.rb
      create    app/models/tweet.rb
      invoke    rspec
      create      spec/models/tweet_spec.rb
      invoke      factory_bot
      create        spec/factories/tweets.rb

run the migrations so changes are made to the database
  bundle exec rails db:migrate db:test:prepare

    what is the db:test:prepare for?

      so your test database is consistent with the changes you do to your development database

      this way your new tests do not fail for syncing problems between development and test databases

    this migration creates the table in the database
