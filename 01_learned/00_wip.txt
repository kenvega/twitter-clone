    approx at 12 min when starting to create the username controller

      creates a single controller just to have two methods: the new form that handles the redirect and updates the username
                                                              and the method that actually updates the username

                                                              the idea is to avoid having more logic in the controller
                                                                so that every controller has its own responsability
