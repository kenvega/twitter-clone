if you want to backup all your postgres database

  you can do this

    <path-of-postgres-pg_dump> <name-of-your-database> > <path-of-your-exported-database-file>.sql

    example for when I'm using Postgres.app for mac

      /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin/pg_dump twitter_clone_development > ~/Documents/postgresbackups/twitter_clone_dev.sql

      you might be able to just do pg_dump directly if you already have it in your path

        i think this could help but i haven't tried it https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html

  in my case i wanted to backup before resetting the database with rails to test seeds

if you want to recover a postgres backup you could do

  psql your_database_name < backup_file.sql

    haven't tried
