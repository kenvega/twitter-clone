how can you test regular expressions

  open a rails console and test with .match for the first match or .scan for all the matches
    e.g.

      words = "ruby #rails is ok"

      words.match(/#.+/)  # this would return MatchData "#rails is ok"

      words.match(#\w+) # returns -> MatchData "#rails"
