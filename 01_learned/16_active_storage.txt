active storage

  source: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html

  to set profile pictures

  normally never used but needed for this mvp case

  bundle exec rails active_storage:install

    this creates a migration that will create the necessary tables to support files/images/etc

  then in config/environments/development.rb

    make sure this line is set to local if you are not using another service like aws to store the files/images/etc

      config.active_storage.service = :local

  then if you want to for example make your user have an avatar you will need to add this to its model

    has_one_attached :avatar

  active_storage_attachments is the table where it saves the info of what field from which model is related to an attachment

    it also directs with a blob_id

      which leads to the other table active_storage_blobs where you have the info for the attachment itself (name, filetype, etc)

  normally you would need to resize the images
    or you could add probably validations to make sure files are not more than a certain size

    if you want to resize you might need to install some dependencies like imagemagick
