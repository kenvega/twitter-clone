polling solution

  models
    Message
      why
        to save the messages sent somewhere

      attributes
        users (sender_id)
        body
        conversation_id

      associations
        message belongs to a sender(user)

        user(sender) can have many messages

    Channel / Conversation / MessageThread
      why
        because some messages pertain to a conversation of two or more people

      attributes
        id

      associations
        have_and_belong_to_many users

    User
      why
        users are the ones who send the messages

      associations
        have_and_belong_to_many conversations
          because of the join table chatmember


    Subscription / Subscriber / ChannelUser / ConversationUser / ChatMember / MessageThreadUser
      why
        a join table between the User and the Channel tables is needed
          this way we can list all the Channels a user pertains to
        this will be also a model because we will handle some logic with it
          so we won't do a has_and_belongs_to_many association instead we will do a has_many through association in the join model
            the tests should be updated based on that

      attributes
        user_id
        channel_id

        * notice there is no need for an id for this

      associations
        belongs to a User
        belongs to a Channel


for the 'building' of new messages when clicking a message to a new user

  for now it's just using the profile user to simulate the channel


instead of using the Subscription join model we could just do some postgresql queries

  but we will leave a model so it's easier for people who don't know about postgresql queries
