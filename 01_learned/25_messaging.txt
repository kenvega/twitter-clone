polling solution

  models
    Message
      why
        to save the messages sent somewhere

      attributes
        users (sender_id)
        body
        conversation_id

      associations
        message belongs to a sender(user)

        user(sender) can have many messages

    Channel / Conversation / MessageThread
      why
        because some messages pertain to a conversation of two or more people

      attributes
        id

      associations
        have_and_belong_to_many users

    User
      why
        users are the ones who send the messages

      associations
        have_and_belong_to_many conversations
          because of the join table chatmember


    Subscriber / ChannelUser / ConversationUser / ChatMember / MessageThreadUser
      why
        a join table between the User and the Conversations tables is needed
          this way we can list all the Conversations a user pertains to
        this will be also a model because we will handle some logic with it
          so we won't do a has_and_belongs_to_many association instead we will do a has_many through association in the join model
            the tests should be updated based on that

      attributes
        user_id
        channel_id

        * notice there is no need for an id for this

      associations
        belongs to a User
        belongs to a Channel
