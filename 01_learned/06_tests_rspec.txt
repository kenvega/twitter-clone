to run tests you run

  bundle exec rspec

to use helper methods from the devise gem and factory_bot gem in your rspec tests
  you have to make changes to spec/rails_helper.rb

  make sure to add these 2 configs
    RSpec.configure do |config|
      config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods
      ...
      config.include Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers, type: :request
    end

    the line
      config.include Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers, type: :request

        will allow you to use methods in your rspec tests like
          sign_in
          sign_out
          current_user

    and the line
      config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods

        will allow you to use methods in your rspec tests like
          create # to create instances of a factory with the specified attributes


an example of how a test can be done

  in the file spec/models/user_spec.rb you can have these tests:

    require 'rails_helper'

    RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
      it { should have_many(:tweets).dependent(:destroy) }
      it { should validate_uniqueness_of(:username).case_insensitive.allow_blank }
    end
