requirements to start
  ruby version 3.1.1
  rails version 7.0.4
  node v18.13.0
  make sure you install yarn globally -> npm install -g yarn

how to install when cloning this repo
  in the root of this project
    bundle install

how to run the app
  in the root folder run the command
    ./bin/dev
      this will start the rails server and also will make sass and bootstrap to work

===

command I used to create this rails project
  rails new twitter-clone -T -d postgresql --css=bootstrap
    this will set bootstrap as a css framework

I made sure to create files in the root of the project that forced me to use specific node and ruby versions
  .nvmrc
  .ruby-version

problems I had creating/setting up the project
  I didn't install yarn before the command so I had problems

  I was using an M1 chip so I had to make sure I did all commands on an i386 architecture
    to see which architecture your terminal/shell is using just run the command: arch

  I had to update rbenv to make sure I was able to install ruby 3.1.1
    I was able to update it with the same command I used to install it. from here: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer#:~:text=not%20already%20available.-,%23%20with%20curl,-curl%20%2DfsSL%20https

  I had problems with esbuild not installing when creating the rails app so I had to install it manually
    not sure what caused this but when creating the app there was no output from yarn (meaning nothing was compiling with esbuild)

      to install esbuild manually and compile manually
        yarn add esbuild
        yarn build
        yarn build:css

      then I was able to run the rails app with ./bin/dev normally

  I had sass gem installed in another version of ruby and had problems with that
    had to remove the whole ruby version to make sure it worked
    probably not necessary to remove the other ruby version just make sure esbuild is installed first (previous issue)
