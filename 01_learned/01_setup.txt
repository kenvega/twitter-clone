requirements to start
  ruby version 3.1.1
  node v18.13.0
  make sure you install yarn globally -> npm install -g yarn

command to initialize rails project
  rails new twitter-clone -T -d postgresql --css=bootstrap
    this will set bootstrap as a css framework

problems I had
  didn't install yarn before the command so I had problems
  I had sass gem installed in another version of ruby and had problems with that. Had to remove the whole ruby version to make sure it worked
  I was using an M1 chip so I had to make sure I did all commands on an i386 architecture
    to see which architecture your terminal/shell is using just run the command: arch
  I had to update rbenv to make sure I was able to install ruby 3.1.1
    I was able to update it with the same command I used to install it. from here: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer#:~:text=not%20already%20available.-,%23%20with%20curl,-curl%20%2DfsSL%20https

how to run the app
  in the root folder run the command
    ./bin/dev
      this will start the rails server and also will make sass and bootstrap to work
