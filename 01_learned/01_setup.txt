requirements to start
  ruby version 3.1.1
  rails version 7.0.4
  node v18.13.0
  make sure you install yarn globally -> npm install -g yarn
    if you don't have yarn you will probably have issues with precompiling

how to install when cloning this repo
  in the root of this project
    bundle install

how to run the app
  in the root folder run the command
    ./bin/dev
      this will start the rails server and also will make sass and bootstrap to work

  for background jobs to run (for example to update the views when showing a single tweet)
    in another terminal run
      bundle exec rails jobs:work
        this runs the workers that pick the queued jobs in the delayed_jobs table

if you have problems from the styles not really changing
  you might need to run this command
    ./bin/rails assets:precompile

      and then restart the server with ./bin/dev

command I used to create this rails project
  rails new twitter-clone -T -d postgresql --css=bootstrap
    this will set bootstrap as a css framework

I made sure to create files in the root of the project that forced me to use specific node and ruby versions
  .nvmrc ---> v18.13.0
  .ruby-version ---> 3.1.1

problems I had creating/setting up the project
  I didn't install yarn before the command so I had problems
    error: The asset "application.css" is not present in the asset pipeline
      tried to fixed with: ./bin/rails assets:precompile
        then i noticed that i didn't have yarn installed globally for my node version

  I was using an M1 chip so I had to make sure I did all commands on an i386 architecture
    to see which architecture your terminal/shell is using just run the command: arch

  I had to update rbenv to make sure I was able to install ruby 3.1.1
    I was able to update it with the same command I used to install it. from here: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer#:~:text=not%20already%20available.-,%23%20with%20curl,-curl%20%2DfsSL%20https

  I had problems with esbuild not installing when creating the rails app so I had to install it manually
    not sure what caused this but when creating the app there was no output from yarn (meaning nothing was compiling with esbuild)

      to install esbuild manually and compile manually
        yarn add esbuild
        yarn build
        yarn build:css

      then I was able to run the rails app with ./bin/dev normally

      source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/73130514

  I had sass gem installed in another version of ruby and had problems with that
    had to remove the whole ruby version to make sure it worked
    probably not necessary to remove the other ruby version just make sure esbuild is installed first (previous issue)


questions to test

  I think the method create_with does not really create anything if it is not chained to other method

    how to test

      have a model in this project that is not the user

        use the method like this

          Tweet.create_with(text: "this is a test tweet")

          you can put this code in an action to see if it really created something or if it needs to be chained to something else to create
    
          then try to chain it with find_or_create_by
