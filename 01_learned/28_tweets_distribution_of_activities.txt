tweet distribution types

twitter shows you activities in the homepage based on these and more conditions:

- tweets I myself created
- tweets from people I'm following
- tweets that were liked by the people that I'm following
- tweets that were replied to by the people that I'm following
- tweets that were retweeted by the people that I'm following

we can call these activities and save them in a table

  so we will save information where relevant users to you do some activities
  and then tie every activity to a specific tweet


this is a table that
  gets populated as the relevant users to me
    start doing these things:
  these activities are tied to a tweet
