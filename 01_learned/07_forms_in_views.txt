an example on a form in a view with erb


<%=form_with model: Tweet.new, url: tweets_path, local: true do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :body %>
  <%= f.submit %>
<%end%>

tweets_path is the path where you make your POST requests to create new tweets
  you can also use a GET to this same path to get all tweets

remember to try to avoid putting logic in views as much as possible
