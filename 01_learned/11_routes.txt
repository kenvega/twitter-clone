if you want to see the routes of your rails app

  rails routes

if you want to filter the routes for a specific controller

  bundle exec rails routes -c usernames # where c means controller

you can check more options at

  bundle exec rails routes --help


you can set only methods to create a few routes
  resources :usernames, only: [:new, :update]

  this line only creates
    GET /usersnames/new --- which will go to controller#action -> usernames#new
    PATCH /usernames/:id --- usernames#update
    PUT /usernames/:id --- usernames#update
