if you want to see the routes of your rails app

  rails routes

if you want to filter the routes for a specific controller

  bundle exec rails routes -c usernames # where c means controller

you can check more options at

  bundle exec rails routes --help


paths like 'new_username_path' can be obtained when looking at all the routes

  when checking all the routes with rails routes or through looking at localhost:3000/rails/info/routes

    look at the prefix route and then just at '_path' at the end

      example
                Prefix Verb  URI Pattern              Controller#Action
          new_username GET   /usernames/new(.:format) usernames#new
              username PATCH /usernames/:id(.:format) usernames#update
                       PUT   /usernames/:id(.:format) usernames#update

          for this case you can see that if you want to redirect to the view to create a new username (usernames#new)
            you can do this
              redirect_to new_username_path


you can set only methods to create a few routes
  resources :usernames, only: [:new, :update]

  this line only creates
    GET /usersnames/new --- which will go to controller#action -> usernames#new
    PATCH /usernames/:id --- usernames#update
    PUT /usernames/:id --- usernames#update
