when making mistakes on console you should look for these keywords
  they normally give you a broad idea of what went wrong

    NoMethodError
      usually you are trying to run a method from an object but you did not handle a case where that object is nil
      and you get an error like this
        undefined method `method_name' for nil:NilClass

    SyntaxError
      self explanatory. it normally mentions the line where you have a syntax error

    StandardError
      has appeared to me when doing something wrong with migrations before


for rspec I've seen this error
  Failure/Error
