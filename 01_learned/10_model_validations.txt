to validate uniqueness of a field in a table. example

  class User < ApplicationRecord
    ...

    validates :username, uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }, allow_blank: true
  end

  if you added this validation after creating a few users you will have blank usernames so they wouldn't be valid
    but with the allow_blank: true you avoid this issue
