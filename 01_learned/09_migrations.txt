to run your created migrations (for db and test db)

  bundle exec rails db:migrate db:test:prepare

first migration to change a table was to add a username field to the users table

  you can use camel case or snake case in the migration name. both will work the same

    bundle exec rails g migration add_username_to_users username:string

    bundle exec rails g migration AddUsernameToUsers other:string

example on how to add a column with a unique index

  def change
    add_column :users, :username, :string, index: { unique: true }
  end

  bundle exec rails g stimulus tweet_card

  bundle exec rails g model View user:references tweet:references

  bundle exec rails g migration add_views_count_to_tweets views_count:integer
    # learned here that the migration file and its class name can change after you generate them. no problem from rails
        issue here is that first it was called viewed_count instead of views_count
          then a rollback was made and then the file name, the column name and the class name of the migration were changed
            no problems from rails were created from this
              I thought when using generators somehow the records of the rails app were locked to certain names that couldn't be changed later  
                (there are so many files in the rails app so I thought something like that might happen)

  bundle exec rails g migration add_parent_tweet_id_to_tweets tweet_id:bigint
    notice we add a tweet_id as bigint to be consistent with the tweet_id that is already in our tables (is bigint/int8 already)

  bundle exec rails g migration add_bio_to_users bio:text
    in larger apps bio should be added to another table called profiles
      this way the core user data can be accessed quicker and the less frequently accessed potentially larger profile data stays also organized
        querying the user data this way will be faster

  bundle exec rails g migration add_location_to_users location:string
  bundle exec rails g migration add_location_to_users bio:string
  bundle exec rails g migration add_url_to_users url:string
