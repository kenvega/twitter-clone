to run your created migrations (for db and test db)

  bundle exec rails db:migrate db:test:prepare

first migration to change a table was to add a username field to the users table

  you can use camel case or snake case in the migration name. both will work the same

    bundle exec rails g migration add_username_to_users username:string

    bundle exec rails g migration AddUsernameToUsers other:string

to add a field with a unique index here there is an example

  def change
    add_column :users, :username, :string, index: { unique: true }
  end
