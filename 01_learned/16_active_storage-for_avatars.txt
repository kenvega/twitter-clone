active storage

  source: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html

  to set profile pictures (or avatars)

  normally this is not used but it's needed for this mvp

  how to set it up:

    bundle exec rails active_storage:install

      this creates a migration that will create the necessary tables to support files/images/etc

    then in config/environments/development.rb

      make sure this line is set to local if you are not using another service like aws to store the files/images/etc

        config.active_storage.service = :local

    then if you want to for example make your user have an avatar you will need to add this to its model

      has_one_attached :avatar


  about the tables created:

    active_storage_blobs
      stores metadata about the file/blob that is saved
          like the filename, content type (e.g., image/png), byte size, etc.

    active_storage_attachments
      it's basically a join table that connects a model (like User) with a blob that is saved in active_storage_blobs
        so it determines which blob is related with which record


  other considerations:

    normally you would need to resize the images
      or you could add probably validations to make sure files are not more than a certain size

      if you want to resize you might need to install some dependencies like imagemagick
